CS210

This upload is Project Three from CS210.
Your task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.
The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. 
1.	Print the list with numbers that represent the frequency of all items purchased.
The screen output should include every item (represented by a word) paired with the number of times that item appears in the input file, CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt. For example, the file might read as follows:
         Potatoes 4
         Pumpkins 5
         Onions 3
1.	Print the same frequency information for all the items in the form of a histogram. 
2.	Then print the name, followed by asterisks or another special character to represent the numeric amount.
The number of asterisks should equal the frequency read from the CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt file. For example, if the file includes 4 potatoes, 5 pumpkins, and 3 onions, then your text-based histogram may appear as represented below. However, you can alter the appearance or color of the histogram in any way you choose:
        Potatoes ****
        Pumpkins *****
        Onions ***
        create an option to exit
	For this assignment, your implementation plan must include at least one class with public and private sections. For assistance with classes, see sections 6.2, "Using a Class," and 6.3, "Defining a Class," in zyBooks.
	For this assignment, we recommend using Maps (section 11.4 in zyBooks) for implementation. Maps do require precise coding syntax. However, you can choose a different implementation option. 


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was a program written for a grocery stoe to show them what items were being purchased the most. They wanted to see the items that needed to be displayed in the front where the customers could purchase them easier. 
What did you do particularly well?
I included all three menu items including the option for the usser to exit. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance my code by adding in a class with a public and private portion. 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I did not quite understand the data file creation yet. If I had added this in it would have been complete. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This whole project will be very helpfule in the future especially if I add in what was missing. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I added in readability by creating a better looking menu. I think I made it more exciting to continue to the next options for the user.
